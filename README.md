Goblin Food and Recipes
-----------------------

Any mischeivious creature will find great value in a [*good pressure cooker*](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Multi-Functional-Pressure/dp/B00FLYWNYQ). 
Many of these foods are still craftable without one (a crock pot often suffices) but
the convenience and speed of a pressure cooker makes these recipes fly by! Which
makes it much easier for a goblin to craft their own food!

*Approved Wee Goblin Cooking Oils*
 
 * Coconut Oil
 * Olive Oil

### Stock

The foundation of most all goblin dishes, a good bone stock makes anything and everything taste so much better 
and so much healither. Simple to make and simple to store!

* Tools *

* Pressure Cooker or Crock Pot
* Something to squish garlic
* A second pot to pour the finished stock into
* A sieve to catch all the little bits during pouring

*Ingredients*

 * Bones (ex. Left overs from costco chicken, beef soup bones from winco)
 * Head of Garlic
 * 2 pork feet halves (Frozen pork feet are at winco usually, also at a local butcher)
 
 For extra awesome stock (optional, not required)

 * Dried Star Anise (usually found in an asian market, or perhaps the seasoning aisle of a grocery store)
 * Bay Leaf

*Crafting*

  1. Put bones into pressure cooker/crock pot
  2. Take out a cutting board and big knife or spatula
  3. Pull apart garlic head into cloves
      * Put under flat of knife or spatula
      * Crush by pressing with palm of hand against tool
  4. Toss garlic into pot
  5. Toss pork feet into pot
  6. Toss bay leaf and anise if desired
  7. Fill with water
  8. Close pressure cooker/crock pot and:
    * Set to 2 hours in pressure cooker 
    * Set to LOW in crock-pot and wait 8 hours/overnight
  9. Set the second pot into a kitchen sink
  10. Ready the sieve over the second pot
  11. Lift the stock-filled pot out of the pressure cooker/crockpot and
  carefully pour through the sieve into the second pot. 
  
  To quickly cool the stock...
  
  1. Plug the kitchen sink
  2. Pour cold water into the kitchen sink AROUND the filled pot of stock
  3. Stir the stock continuously until you can stick a (very) clean finger into the stock
  without burning yourself, you should be able to now safely stick the pot of stock in the 
  fridge to chill the rest of the way.
