Goblin Food and Recipes
-----------------------

Any mischeivious creature will find great value in a [*good pressure cooker*](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Multi-Functional-Pressure/dp/B00FLYWNYQ). 
Many of these foods are still craftable without one (a crock pot often suffices) but
the convenience and speed of a pressure cooker makes these recipes fly by! Which
makes it much easier for a goblin to craft their own food!

= Approved Wee Goblin Cooking Oils
 
 * Coconut Oil

* Vegetables

== Stock

The foundation of most all goblin dishes, a good bone stock makes anything and everything taste so much better 
and so much healither. Simple to make and simple to store!

=== Ingredients

 * Bones (ex. Left overs from costco chicken, beef soup bones from winco)
 * Head of Garlic
 * 2 pork feet halves (Frozen pork feet are at winco usually, also at a local butcher)
 
 For extra awesome stock (optional, not required)
