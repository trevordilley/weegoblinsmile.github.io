Goblin Food and Recipes
-----------------------

Any mischeivious creature will find great value in a [*good pressure cooker*](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Multi-Functional-Pressure/dp/B00FLYWNYQ). 
Many of these foods are still craftable without one (a crock pot often suffices) but
the convenience and speed of a pressure cooker makes these recipes fly by! Which
makes it much easier for a goblin to craft their own food!
