Goblin Food and Recipes
-----------------------

Any mischeivious creature will find great value in a [*good pressure cooker*](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-IP-DUO60-Multi-Functional-Pressure/dp/B00FLYWNYQ). 
Many of these foods are still craftable without one (a crock pot often suffices) but
the convenience and speed of a pressure cooker makes these recipes fly by! Which
makes it much easier for a goblin to craft their own food!

*Approved Wee Goblin Cooking Oils*

### Stock

The foundation of most all goblin dishes, a good bone stock makes anything and everything taste so much better 
and so much healither. Simple to make and simple to store!

*Tools*

* Pressure Cooker or Crock Pot
* Something to squish garlic
* A second pot to pour the finished stock into
* A sieve to catch all the little bits during pouring

*Ingredients*

 * Bones (ex. Left overs from costco chicken, beef soup bones from winco)
 * Head of Garlic
 * 2 pork feet halves (Frozen pork feet are at winco usually, also at a local butcher)
 
 For extra awesome stock (optional, not required)

 * Dried Star Anise (usually found in an asian market, or perhaps the seasoning aisle of a grocery store)
 * Bay Leaf

_Notice we do not add salt here! That is because this is an ingredient to cook other foods, so we don't want to risk ruining a future dish because we 
didn't salt (also called seasoning) correctly!_

*Crafting*

  1. Put bones into pressure cooker/crock pot
  2. Take out a cutting board and big knife or spatula
  3. Pull apart garlic head into cloves

    * Set to LOW in crock-pot and wait 8 hours/overnight
  9. Set the second pot into a kitchen sink
  10. Ready the sieve over the second pot
  11. Lift the stock-filled pot out of the pressure cooker/crockpot and
  carefully pour through the sieve into the second pot. 
  
  To quickly cool the stock...
  
  1. Plug the kitchen sink
  2. Pour cold water into the kitchen sink AROUND the filled pot of stock
  3. Stir the stock continuously until you can stick a (very) clean finger into the stock
  without burning yourself, you should be able to now safely stick the pot of stock in the 
  fridge to chill the rest of the way.

  12. Pork is going sizzle and STICK to the pot. This is okay.
  13. Now we want to brown each side of the pork cubes. Let it sizzle 
  and watch the edges. When you see one that is brown and you feel a little
  uncomfortable, go ahead and use your spatula and tongs to pry a piece of 
  pork off to check it. If it's not orange-y brown and incredibly satisfying 
  to look at, put it back on the oil and continue waiting. Use this piece as your
  reference piece when you want to check again. 
  14. Once all sides of the pork have browned satisfactorily, remove pork from pot
  and place on the extra plate to set aside. 
  15. Add chopped onion to pot.
  16. Use wooden spoon to scrape along bottom of pot to remove the delicious brown bits
  the pork left. As the onion cooks, it's water will release and deglaze the pan, making

  bottom of the pot.

  25. Cook stock down till it's pleasantly thick. 
  26. Throw in fistful of dates and take pot off the heat. 
  27. Put pot in a kitchen sink filled with cold water and stir pot until it's not
  too hot to blend. 
  28. Blend cooled pot of sauce till smooth
  29. Put pot into pressure cooker
  30. Add a little bit of stock to make sure it has enough water to steam. 
  31. Add that pork you cooked 20 steps ago back into the pot and stir around to cover
  32. Seal pressure cooker
  33. Set for 45 minutes
  34. Wait 45 minutes
